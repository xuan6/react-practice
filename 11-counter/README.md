## Functional Requirements

Your App component:
- displays a count for an inventory
- allows you to increase/decrease the displayed count
- offers a "Reorder" button when the count is 0
  - implement this in a Reorder component that is only shown when the count is 0
  - which adds 5 to the count
- does not allow you to decrease the count below 0
- Pressing the Reorder button sets the inventory count to 5

## Visual Requirements
- The buttons should have some space between them and each other as well as the output text
- the inventory count, the +/- buttons, and the Reorder button should all appear on the same line
- The Reorder button is only shown when the Count is 0
- When it appears, the reorder button will have a "fade in" animation
